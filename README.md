### Changes:
1. **Project Images**: I've included placeholders (with the text "Responsive Webpage," "Stopwatch App," etc.). Replace the URLs with actual image links of your projects.
   - You can upload your project screenshots to your GitHub repository or use other image hosting services like [Imgur](https://imgur.com) and replace the `https://via.placeholder.com/600x300.png?text=...` URL with the actual image URL.

2. **Tech Stack**: Added a line under each project to describe the specific tech stack (e.g., Front-end, JavaScript, API Integration).
